# PWA Android Calculator

This project is my attempt to building a [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/). 
The idea was to build a replica of the native Android Calculator app by Google, but on the web, using simply HTML, CSS and JS. 

The project is functional i.e. the calculator does work, but it's not finished it.
